This was bound to happen eventually. I've been seeing "start<sup>[1](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/)</sup> a <sup>[2](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045)</sup> blog<sup>[3](http://will-stanton.com/creating-a-data-science-portfolio-with-no-real-world-experience/)</sup>" advice all over the place ever since I first dipped a toe into #rstats Twitter, but I figured I couldn't be bothered with maintaining it. As the negligent owner of a tragically stereotypical (and now defunct) "gap year travel blog," I've been burned before. I didn't want to create false obligations for myself for nothing, or become the ["sorry I haven't posted" guy](http://sorry.coryarcangel.com).  

But, like many around me, I eventually reached a tipping point. The person who got me there was [Emily Zabor](https://twitter.com/zabormetrics), a fellow New York R Lady and resident blogdown sage. Emily gave a talk on hosting your own website that _I wasn't even able to go to_, but her [tutorial materials](www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html) were so good that it didn't even matter. 

So, thanks to Emily, this space exists. (Others, including [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) and [Mara Averick](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/10/updating-blogdown-hugo-version-netlify/), also wrote super helpful posts that helped me navigate hosting and deploying sites using Netlify and Github.)

I'll use it primarily for two reasons: 

1. I am working on Very Weird Side Projects, and I want to talk about them for more than 280 characters.  
2. I Google the same things CONSTANTLY. I'd like to do less of that. 
3. Peppering my R Markdowns with the occasional Good Place GIF.

Here goes nothing.

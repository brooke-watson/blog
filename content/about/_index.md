#### ABOUT

I'm a Director of Legal Analytics & Quantitative Research at the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/), where my team uses code and statistics to support civil rights litigation and legislation. I'm interested in the ways that data can inform civic society, and the ways that society decides what kind of data is collected and valued. 

Prior to joining the ACLU I worked in public health and infectious disease research, completing my Master's degree in epidemiology from the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research) and working as a Research Scientist with [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/). I'm currently based in New York, but was born and raised in Memphis, and swam for Tennessee's [Lady Vols](http://utsports.com/news/2012/6/22/17_UT_Swimmers_Depart_for_Olympic_Trials.aspx).

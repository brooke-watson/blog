#### About Brooke 

I am a Senior Data Scientist at the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/), where I use code and statistics to support civil rights litigation and advocacy. Previously, I worked in public health and disease research, most recently as a Research Scientist with the [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/). I completed my Master's degree in epidemiology from the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research), and swam for Tennessee's [Lady Vols](http://utsports.com/news/2012/6/22/17_UT_Swimmers_Depart_for_Olympic_Trials.aspx) as an undergrad.

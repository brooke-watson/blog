description: Building reusable pipelines that can bend and not break when new data is introduced.

A while ago, I wrote a piece for our ACLU [tech & analytics blog](https://medium.com/aclu-tech-analytics/) about how to write analytical pipelines that work on new data, in a world where even data structures may change constantly. It's available [here](https://medium.com/aclu-tech-analytics/flexible-reproducibility-in-data-workflows-6505c515054a), alongside many other thoughtful and practical pieces of writing about civic tech at a civil rights nonprofit law firm. (If you're heading that way, I'd also strongly recommend Priya's [post](https://medium.com/aclu-tech-analytics/manifesting-tech-for-social-good-my-aclu-internship-experience-be32c431a5c3) about her internship on our team, Tom's [piece](https://medium.com/aclu-tech-analytics/i-cannot-accept-the-terms-31bf5d74d6e0) on the contract peculiarities of data engineering at the ACLU, or Jung-Hee's excellent [guide](https://medium.com/aclu-tech-analytics/check-yo-data-before-you-wreck-yo-results-53f0e919d0b9) to assertions and quality control in data pipelines.)

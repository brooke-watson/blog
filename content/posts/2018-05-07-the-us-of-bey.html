<p>Beyoncé Knowles-Carter is an icon who needs no introduction. In her 36 years, she has become the top selling artist of the 21st century, <a href="http://www.mtv.co.uk/beyonce/news/beyonce-named-highestearning-black-artist-of-all-time">highest-paid</a> black artist of all time, the most-nominated woman in <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/grammys-2015/6363698/beyonce-most-grammy-nominated-woman">Grammy history</a>, and the top selling artist of the last decade. <em>Time</em> put her on the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27154568">cover</a> of its 100 most influential people issue.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/president-obama-the-legacy/growing-barack-meet-three-boys-named-after-president-obama-n709046">other legends</a>, Queen Bey’s prominance has spawned a wave of namesakes. Mrs. Knowles-Carter needs no last name to be recognized - But what of the Beyoncés who <em>do</em>? Where are they? Is the name getting more popular as her fame grows? What’s it like to be named Beyoncé in high school in 2015?</p>
<p>Thanks to the <code>babynames</code> package in R - along with some additional open data from the Social Security Administration - it’s pretty easy to answer the first few questions. For the last, we have <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/celebrity-names-girl-named-beyonce-humans-of-new-york/">Humans of New York</a>.</p>

<h1>About the data</h1>
<p>The United States Social Security Administration releases yearly summaries of baby names reported on Social Security card applications, dating back to 1910 and sorted by sex. The data is aggregated at both the national and state level. <strong>To safeguard privacy, the SSA restricts the list of names to those with at least 5 occurrences per year, per sex.</strong> At the state level, these same restrictions apply, so if less than 5 names of either sex are reported in a given year and state, the sum of the state totals will be less than the national total.</p>
<p>This is why no Beyoncés show up in the data in 1981, the year Queen Bey was born.</p>

<p>The first real crop of modern Beyoncés show up in the data in 1998. This is the year of Destiny’s Child’s first self-titled album, and the first year she emerges on the map. While some sparsely populated Yoncés <em>could</em> have trickled, unaggregated, through Social Security records throughout the 20th century, the first sizable cohort - 18 Beyoncés - was born two decades ago, when Queen Bey was only 17 years old.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, the trend of naming a child Beyoncé peaked quickly in 2001, around the release of the Destiny’s Child album <em>Survivor</em>. This was before her solo career began, let alone before she took over the world.</p>
<p>Perhaps in 2001, it was easier to think of “<em>Beyoncé</em>” as merely a beautiful, unique name that was growing in familiarity on local radios - much like the names <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B">Belcardis</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normani">Normani</a> may be today.</p>

<h1>Alternative Yoncés</h1>
<p>By 2001, names that <em>rhyme</em> with Beyoncé were also picking up steam. They get massively overshadowed in the larger graph, but there are quite a few of these Alternate Yoncés, and the cohorts persist over several years before puttering out around 2007. But which ones are most popular?</p>

<h1>The US of Bey: Statewide Distribution of Beyoncés</h1>
<p>We’ve looked at how these patterns vary over time. But how do they vary spatially? Are there more Beyoncés in Texas, her home state? Did the south catch on earlier than the north, or the east before the west?</p>
<p>Because of the privacy protections around public SSA data, some of the data gets lost when disaggregated at the state-wide level. However, there are still some name patterns that can be picked up in the peak years.</p>

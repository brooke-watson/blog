division: Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington.

Deaths - Total number of deaths occurring within the
resident population of an area during the period, as reported by
the Census Bureau's Federal-State Cooperative Program for
Population Estimates (FSCPE) and the National Center for Health
Statistics.

Demographic Components of Change - The demographic components of
population change consist of births, deaths, net domestic
migration, and net international migration.

FIPS State Code - Two digit Federal Information Processing Standards 
(FIPS) codes uniquely identify each state and state equivalent. They 
are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Natural Increase - births minus deaths in an area.  The rate of 
natural increase expresses natural increase during a time period
as a percentage of an area's initial population.

Net Domestic Migration - the difference between
domestic in-migration to an area and domestic
out-migration from it during the period.  Domestic in-migration and
out-migration consist of moves where both the origins and
destinations are within the United States (excluding Puerto
Rico). The net domestic migration rate expresses net domestic 
migration during a time period as a percentage of an area's 
initial population.

Net Federal Movement - Net Federal movement is the difference
between the movement of federal employees (both military and
civilian) and their dependents into and out of the United States
(excluding Puerto Rico) during the period.

Net International Migration - the difference
between migration to an area from outside the
United States (immigration) and migration from the area to
outside the United States (emigration) during the period.  For
the purposes of these population estimates, the geographic extent
of the United States is defined as excluding Puerto Rico.
Net international migration includes: (1) legal
immigration to the United States as reported by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, (2) an estimate of net undocumented
immigration from abroad, (3) an estimate of emigration from the
United States, and (4) net movement between Puerto Rico and the
(balance of) the United States.  The net international migration
rate expresses net international migration during a time period
as a percentage of an area's initial population.

Numeric Population Change - the difference between the population
of an area at the beginning and end of a time period.

Percent Change- the difference between the population of an area
at the beginning and end of a time period, expressed as a percentage
of the beginning population.

Population (Estimate) -  The estimated population is the computed
number of persons living in the area (resident population) as of
July 1.  The estimated population is calculated from a
demographic components of change model that incorporates
information on natural change (births and deaths) and net
migration (net domestic migration and net movement from abroad)
that has occurred in the area since the reference date of the
1990 census.  Additional information on the methodology used to
produce these population estimates is contained in Current
Population Reports P25-1127 and at our Internet site at:

Resident Population - These population estimates are for the
resident population.  The resident population of a state includes
all residents (both civilian and Armed Forces) living in the
state.  The geographic universe for the resident population is
the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  It excludes Puerto
Rico and outlying areas under United States jurisdiction.  The
resident population excludes U.S. citizens residing abroad.

Residual - The subnational estimates are constrained to sum to an
independently derived estimate of the national population.  The
residual is the difference between an area's population as
estimated by the subnational population estimation procedure
before and after imposing this constraint.  The residual is not a
demographic component of population change; rather, it is a
statistical artifact of the procedures employed to produce the
estimates.
